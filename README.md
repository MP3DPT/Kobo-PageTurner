Welcome to my "bluetooth" Kobo Page Turner project.


The project did born because my wife wanted a pageTurner for the KOBO Libra, and everything she found didn't meet her needs, and as I had some material that I wasn't using, 
I decided to accept the challenge. Basically, I just needed to emulate a keyboard and be able to connect via Bluetooth, to avoid more connections.

This code will simply emulate a keyboard, that is all that is need.
You can change the buttons order to swit your needs.
Or change the Led brightness.

// Define the pins for the buttons and LED
const int buttonPin1 = D5;     // Button 1 (will send Left Arrow)
const int buttonPin2 = D4;     // Button 2 (will send Right Arrow)
const int extLedPin = D9;      // External LED pin (GPIO9)
const int LED_BRIGHTNESS = 1;  // Value between 0-255 for brightness (adjust as needed - If you want a flashlight, put the 255 :P)

Be free to go wild with the design, i made the design in fonction of my wife desier.
